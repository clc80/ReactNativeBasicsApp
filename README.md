# ReactNativeBasicsApp

# Context and goal
I created this app to help me solidify the basics of React Native. As I got acquainted with different parts I created a new route for it. 
This helped me to get experience with coding and to put in practice what I am working on. 

## Main technologies used

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```
- Install the dependencies 
```
npm install
```
- Run on emulator 
```
react-native run-ios
```

### Android steps

- Launch a virtual android device [(through *Android Studio* for instance)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#viewing)

> If you have never installed any android virtual device, [follow those instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd)

- Then, run the project in executing on your project folder:

```
react-native run-android
```
